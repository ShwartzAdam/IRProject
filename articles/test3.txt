• Striga spp. occur in at least 31 countries with rain-fed upland rice systems.

• Rhamphicarpa fistulosa threatens rice production in at least 28 countries.

• 1.34 million ha of rain-fed rice is infested with parasitic weeds in Africa.

• Economic losses inflicted by parasitic weeds most likely reaches US $200M.

• Parasitic weed inflicted losses are estimated to increase by US $30M annually.Parasitic weeds pose increasing threads to rain-fed rice production in Africa.

 Most important species are Striga asiatica, S. aspera and S. hermonthica in rain-fed uplands, and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa in rain-fed lowlands.

 Information on the regional spread and economic importance of parasitic weeds in rice production systems is scant.

 This article presents the first multi-species, multi-country, single-crop impact assessment of parasitic weeds in Africa.

 A systematic search of public international and national herbaria and the scientific literature was conducted to collect all

 available data on the regional distribution, incidences and related yield losses of the most important parasitic weeds in rice.

 Herbaria specimens were geo-referenced and these coordinates were overlapped with rain-fed rice areas.

 Probabilistic diffusion waves of parasitic weeds were generated to derive most likely incidence values.

 Estimates from this spatial analysis were then combined with secondary data from the literature into a

 stochastic impact assessment model to generate a confidence interval of the likely economic impact

 per country and for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. Rhamphicarpa fistulosa occurs in at least

 36 African countries, 28 of which produce rice in rain-fed lowlands where this species thrives.

 Striga hermonthica is found in at least 32 countries, Striga asiatica in at least 44 and

 S. aspera in at least 17. A total of 50 countries have at least one of these three species of Striga,

 31 of which produce rice in the rain-fed uplands where these species can be encountered.

 An estimated 1.34 million ha of rain-fed rice is infested with at least one species of a parasitic

 weed in Africa. Our stochastic model estimates that annual economic losses inflicted by

 all parasitic weeds exceeds with 95% certainty a minimum value of US $111 million and most likely

 reaches roughly US $200 million and increases by US $30 million annually. To reverse this trend and

 support small-holder rice farmers in Africa with effective, sustainable and affordable solutions for control,

 targeted investments in research, development and capacity building are required.

 The top-10 priority countries where such investments would probably have the highest

 return are Nigeria, Guinea, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Tanzania, Madagascar, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Burkina Faso.
