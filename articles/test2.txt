• Field experiment and survey were conducted in Agro-ecosystems of an Oasis in the Heihe River Basin, China.
• Soil water content was reduced by tree belts.
• Soil nitrate was accumulated near the tree beltsUsing tree shelterbelts to protect adjacent crops from the destructive effects of wind, wind-driven particles, direct sunlight,
 and extreme climatic conditions is a common agricultural practice.


Trees and crops, quality however, will inevitably compete for the same water and nutrient resources,

especially along their common border. This study evaluated the effects of shelterbelts on the

amounts of nitrate and water in the adjacent cropland soils under field conditions in an

oasis-desert ecotone in the Heihe River Basin, China. Nitrate contents were measured in an experimental

plot during the cropping season to a depth of 300cm in a poplar/wheat system at distances of 2, 14, 29,

and 42m from the shelterbelt with three replicates in the soil profiles. Both soil-water content and crop yield

increased with distance from the shelterbelt. Nitrate concentrations in the soil, however, generally decreased with

distance from the trees and with depth. Nitrate concentrations in the 200–300cm layer were much higher at distances

from the shelterbelt of 2 and 14m than at 29 and 42m, indicating that more nitrate accumulated in deeper layers

closer to the shelterbelt. A survey of nitrate accumulation in nearby fields supported these findings.

The higher amount of residual nitrogen (N) closer to the shelterbelt was due to the shading of the

crop by the trees that reduced N uptake, mineralization of soil organic matter, and accumulation of litter

and increased the lateral movement of nitrate. The accumulated N compensated for the N lost due to the interception

and uptake by nearby trees. Nitrates likely leached into and polluted the groundwater. Decreasing N fertilization

near the trees and partial replanting of the shelterbelt should be considered for managing nitrate levels in the region.
